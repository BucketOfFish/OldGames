I appear to be learning Java here, so this is probably some of the first code I ever wrote.

The Line/ package appears to be a simple definition of a Line() class.

I have no idea why I would ever code a False Position Method/ function, but it's there too?

Next you have SG/, or SuperGary, made for my brother, in which his character sprite could move around. This was just to learn how to draw stuff and respond to button presses.

Finally, you have Serendipity/, which was a simple activity-suggesting personal-planner kind of thing, which I didn't end up using for very long.
