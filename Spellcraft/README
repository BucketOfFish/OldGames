The first largish game I tried to make, Spellcraft. You could move your character around and cast a variety of spells. I was going to make it a Zelda-esque adventure, before I realized how much work that would take (especially in Java, and without a game engine). I had an idea to cast spells by drawing them on the screen, but since this was before machine learning was a big thing, I didn't know how to get the computer to recognize what I'd drawn.
